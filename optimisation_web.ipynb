    "# Price Optimisation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the equation below, **price elasticity of demand** measures how the demand for a product changes in response to a change in its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity) / (% Change in Price)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the relationship between price and demand enables companies to better predict customer behaviour and make more informed pricing decisions. This, in turn, allows businesses to optimise for profit by setting prices that balance demand with revenue goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to plot the **elasticity curve** of a specific product using historical data from a now-defunct online e-commerce store ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the elasticity curve is established, we will use it to model revenue scenarios and determine an optimal price point.\n",

    "2. A decrease in average price over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When breaking the data down by seller, it becomes clear that seller `4869f7a5dfa277a7dca6462dcf3b52b2` played a key role in driving the price down after **January 2018**. This aggressive pricing strategy allowed them to capture the majority of the market share and effectively set a new market price for the product.\n"

    "# 3. Elasticity Curve and Revenue Modelling\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the top expected revenue scenarios modeled from the elasticity curve, the recommended pricing strategy moving forward — *ceteris paribus* — is to maintain prices within the **$120 to $160** range. Movements within this band should be responsive to the pricing behavior of competing sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since marginal costs were not included in this analysis, there is justification for favoring prices at the **higher end of the range** to maximize profit. However, demand is observed to shrink significantly at prices above **$160**, suggesting diminishing returns beyond this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Limited Data Availability**\n",
    "The dataset covers a relatively short period — from **January 2017 to August 2018** — with total monthly sales peaking at approximately **7,000 units**, while the product in question had only **193 units sold across 27 distinct price points**. This created two key challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparse coverage of the elasticity curve**, leading to high variability between worst-case, median, and best-case scenarios. This variability propagated into the expected revenue estimates.\n",
    "- The absence of a stable market environment makes it difficult to confidently attribute changes in demand solely to price changes, rather than external factors like fluctuating customer traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Lack of Marginal Cost Data**\n",
    "Without information on marginal costs, it is impossible to accurately determine profit-maximizing price points. This limits the ability to provide a complete pricing recommendation. However, the analysis still identified price thresholds — notably prices above **$160** — where demand begins to drop sharply, informing upper boundaries for pricing decisions."
