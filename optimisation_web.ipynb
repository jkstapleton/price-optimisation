    "**Price Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity) / (% Change in Price)**\n",

    "Understanding the relationship between price and demand enables companies to better predict customer behaviour and make more informed pricing decisions. This, in turn, allows businesses to optimise for profit by setting prices that balance demand with revenue goals.\n",

    "The analysis reveals that optimal pricing for this product lies within the **$120-$160 range**, with prices above $160 showing diminishing returns due to steep demand deterioration. The modeling approach, which incorporated worst-case, median, and best-case scenarios through different expectiles, provides a robust framework for understanding demand uncertainty and making informed pricing decisions under varying market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the study faced limitations including sparse data coverage and the absence of marginal cost information, the methodology successfully identified key pricing thresholds and market dynamics. The competitive pricing behavior observed, particularly from seller **4869f7a5dfa277a7dca6462dcf3b52b2**, highlights the importance of monitoring competitor actions and adjusting pricing strategies accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights gained from this model extend beyond the specific product analyzed. The framework demonstrates how businesses can leverage historical transactional data to understand price elasticity, even with limited datasets. The approach of modeling multiple expectiles provides a more comprehensive view of potential outcomes compared to traditional single-point estimates, enabling more confident decision-making in uncertain market environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, this model could be enhanced with additional data sources, including competitor pricing intelligence, seasonal demand patterns, and cost structure information. Nevertheless, the current analysis provides a solid foundation for data-driven pricing decisions and illustrates the practical value of applying advanced analytics to e-commerce pricing optimization."
